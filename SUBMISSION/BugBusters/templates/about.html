<h2 class="mt-3">Coronavirus Predictor (Neerog Jeevan)</h2>
          <p>A simple web application that predicts
          the chances for a person's being infected by COVID-19
          based on symptoms.</p> 
          <p>A dummy dataset and machine learning model are being used
          for the prediction. This application has been built in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript and Python (Flask, NumPy, Pickle, Scikit-Learn).</p>
          <p>Made with ❤️ by <a href="/team">BugBusters</a>.</p>
