### `AR/VR Track 1`

> **Immersive Tech for Good - Easing Disabilities**
> Virtual and Augmented Reality have proven to be a great technology to empower or transform the lives of people with disabilities, be it motor-skills recovery for people who have had a stroke or physical trauma, showing someone in a wheelchair what it is like to go skydiving, or generally making it easier to live with a disability.

### `AR/VR Track 2`

> **Interfaces of Tomorrow**
> I​n the future, personal computing has finally broken into the three dimensional world, and the one device you carry with you, is no longer an object with a screen like your mobile phone, but rather merges seamlessly into your three dimensional reality. What are these interfaces of tomorrow going to look like, doing day-to-day tasks like we do on our phones today? How do you shop online? How do you make a payment? How do you remotely communicate with someone?
> Pick any ONE interesting interpretation of what is currently a common task on your phone, imagine the future, and build it for tomorrow.
